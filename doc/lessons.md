Working on Apollo was very rewarding. Designing and building a compiler seemed
like an incredibly daunting task at the beginning of the semester. However,
working incrementally allowed me to understand the complex system that we were
building and in turn make smarter design decisions. Finishing early version of
the lexer and parser gave me enough time to make changes and polish the
frontend as much as possible.

Working with Haskell was a blast. Although I had played around with it
before PLT, using Haskell to build Apollo proved to be an exciting challenge
and an amazing learning experience. Haskell itself taught me a lot about
language design and forced me to think very closely about how I program in
general.

I was extremely happy with our team. Although we had several debates on
important decision for the language, we ended up getting along really well by
the end of the semester. Working together was really fun and time flew by
during late-night coding sessions. Before PLT, I had mostly worked on software
projects individually, so learning to work collaboratively is probably one of
the biggest takeaways that I'll get from this class.

Perhaps the most exciting part of this project was seeing Apollo in action once
all the parts of our project started to come together. the experience of
writing our first Apollo programs and listening to the cool music that could be
written with it was super exciting. I think I speak for all of us when I say
that there are few things as empowering as writing music with a tool that was
built from the ground up in only a couple of months.
