Introduction
------------

Apollo is a programming language for algorithmic and musical composition. The language provides an interface to leverage light-weight functional paradigms in order to produce a target program that generates a musical output when run. Apollo is intended to be usable by a programmer with knowledge of basic functional constructs and no prior experience with music creation. The fine-details of synthesizing music are abstracted into a familiar typed-interface. Instead of direct note-manipulation, common programming types like integers and characters are mapped to musical values when interpreted. In effect, Apollo thus allows the programmer to *hear the sound of an algorithm*.
